Welcome to the readme file for the Coalmine Safety Monitoring and Alerting System project on GitHub. 

This project aims to enhance the safety of coalmines by monitoring various parameters and alerting the concerned authorities 
in case of any emergency. The system is designed to monitor parameters such as temperature, humidity, gas concentration,
and air quality, among others. 

The system uses sensors to monitor these parameters and sends the data to a central server.
The server processes the data and generates alerts if any of the parameters exceed their threshold values.
The alerts are sent to the concerned authorities via alarm. 

The system also includes a dashboard that displays real-time data from the sensors.
The dashboard provides a visual representation of the data, making it easier for the authorities to understand the situation in the coalmine. 

The Coalmine Safety Monitoring and Alerting System project is open-source and
can be customized to suit the specific needs of different coalmines.
The code is available on GitHub, and users can modify it as per their requirements. 

I hope that this project will help enhance the safety of coalmines and reduce the risk of accidents.
I welcome contributions from the community to improve the system further.
If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to me. 


I have made a prototype of this project to show its working in real time with accuracy feel free to check its working

The system has wide range of applications
                -Smart Air Conditioning with Safety sensors
                -Iot based whether forcasting system
                -pollution detection system on cars  etc.
These can be applied using SensorSoft by modifying with the requirement of the application.

Thank you for your interest in the Coalmine Safety Monitoring and Alerting System project on GitHub.
